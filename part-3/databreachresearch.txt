In October of 2016 hackers used Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaws on the Adult Friend Finder website to access the 
site's database of users. It also turned out that the vast majority of the passwords were hashed weakly using SHA1
making the account easily accessed with the information in the site's database after the passwords were cracked.

The company has since fixed the LFI flaws on the site and now uses stronger hashing.

The motivation behind this attack seems on it's face to be social justice but I'm sure there was some amount of 
blackmail being attempted.
