My encifers will come in the form of a string of letters.

The mover will be the first letter in the strings position in the alphabet plus the last letter in the
strings position in the alphabet. ex. a........e the mover would be 6 bc a=1, e=5 and 1+5=6.

Each letter of the string with the exception of the first and last (they should be dropped) should be
changed to the letter (mover) spaces down from that letters position in the alphabet.
